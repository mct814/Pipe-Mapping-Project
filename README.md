# Pipe-Mapping-Project

## Executive Summary
Since the 19th century, the United States has been laying an infrastructure of piping across the nation to supply
essential resources, such as water and gas, to commercial, government, and residential buildings. In December of 2021,
the government announced a $2.9 billion infrastructure bill that would replace all residential lead pipes with copper pipes.
This poses the question of how maintenance crews will find already existing pipe networks at a low cost without the danger of heavy digging equipment.

Methods currently exist for the detection of the aformentioned large industrial
pipes, but there is a distinct lack of such technology for small, residential PVC
pipes. This project proposes a new way of mapping pipe networks by using a small probe to record positional data
while harmlessly traversing the pipe. The teamâ€™s objective is to create a probe based system to traverse and map variable sized underground pipe networks in 3D space, within an acceptable margin of error. While developing a mechanical pipe traversal method for the probe is part of this project, the primary goal consists of setting up the base technology for 3D mapping and real time information collection inside of 1"-4" PVC pipe.
