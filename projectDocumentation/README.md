# Lessons Learned

* Complete all signoffs as soon as possible, it may take a month or two for parts to be delivered.
* If there is a part that is central to the design like our NXP microcontroller either negotiate to order double what is needed, or plan a backup part if the chip/part is defective.
* Research any software you will use as if your system is already constructed. Our modeling software seemed as if it would be simple to do with little error, until we realized that the majority of software needed an extra component e.g Lidar, magetometer, GPS, ect. this caused many small errors to compound.
* Make sure that you get a stencil and adjust the size so soldering will go by faster. More importantly, especially with tiny components, use apropriatly sized clamp and tools so that the chips can be dropped in place easily and the stencil will not slide leading to an easier application.
* If orders come from Lowes you will need to go get the components yourself.
* IMUs often need a secondary chip/part to cancel out most of its error, by 'recentering' the axes of the accelerometer and gyroscope.
